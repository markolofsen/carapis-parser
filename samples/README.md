## üß™ How to Use

### 1. For Testing
```python
from pathlib import Path

# Load sample HTML
samples_dir = Path("parsers/parser_demo/samples/html")
with open(samples_dir / "listing_page.html", "r") as f:
    html_content = f.read()

# Test your extractor
extractor = DemoListingExtractor()
cars = extractor.extract_cars_from_html(html_content)
print(f"Found {len(cars)} cars")
```

### 2. For Learning
- Study the HTML structure
- Understand the data patterns
- See how selectors should work
- Learn about pagination and navigation

### 3. For Development
- Use as templates for your own parsers
- Modify to match your target website structure
- Test different HTML variations
